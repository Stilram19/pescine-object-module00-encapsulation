(*) struct vs class in c++:

struct and class can be used interchangeably, but the class keyword is the most popular in c++.
the main difference is the default access control: while everything inside a class is private
by default, everything inside a struct is public by default.
the main reason why structs exist in c++ is for compatibility with c.
So, There is no difference, apart from default encapsulation.

(*) friend keyword:

this keyword is used with classes and functions. a friend class or function can access
the private and protected members. for functions they can be either global or member functions
of other classes.
Member functions cannot be declared as friends.
for the std::ostream &operator<< function can be declared as a member function but the problem
is that it can only have one argument. that's why you need to use the friend keyword.
